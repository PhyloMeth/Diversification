best.model
# What are the parameters of the best model? What do you think they mean?

# The parameter of ddl include the initial speciation rate and the K parameter which corresponds to carrying capacity. This model puts into consideration the implcations of higher diversity in a lineage in the context of the ecosystem.

# Now try running BAMM. Use the tutorial at http://bamm-project.org/quickstart.html to do diversification analyses.
